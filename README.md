# ðŸš€ RabbitMQ Consumer for Fast Track Aero Push Notifications
## This repository contains a Node.js service that listens to RabbitMQ messages and forwards them as push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
  - Notifications are created and sent to RabbitMQ by a Next.js API.
  - This consumer service processes and delivers those notifications to users of the Fast Track Aero mobile app (React Native & Expo).
  - Ensures efficient, scalable, and real-time push notifications.
